## Why 
This project was born out of a real-world business need. As the creator of a YouTube channel with over 167,000 subscribers , my single biggest bottleneck during editing was video research. 

**The Problem:**
Manually scrubbing through hours of footage to find one specific moment was inefficient and creatively draining. I was spending 2-3 hours per video just searching for clips.

**The Solution:**
I built VideoFinder - an AI-powered search engine that understands video 
content and returns exact timestamps in seconds.
